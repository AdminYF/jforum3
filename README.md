JForum
============

*jforum is a powerful and robust discussion board system implemented in Java*

***Disclaimer: I am not actively working on the code anymore, as I moved to another projects and priorities over the years. I keep it here for historical reasons and because it may be useful to someone***


To build jforum just run `mvn package`

You can find database initialization scripts in `src/main/resources/jforumConfig/database` folder.
